## Cohesity CERT (Cyber Event Response Team)

Respond faster, recover smarter-because your business can't afford downtime.

## Key Benefits

- • Less downtime and data loss
- • Rapid incident response
- • Efficient  data restoration

Cyberattacks are one of the biggest causes of data loss and downtime. Cyberattacks are not a matter of if but when. Ransomware, data breaches, and wiper attacks are on the rise, and businesses of all sizes are vulnerable. When an attack occurs, the focus shifts from prevention to response and recovery so the organization can continue operating.

- • Expert guidance in a crisis

To reduce the impact of a cyberattack, we've enhanced our world-class data security solution with a dedicated Cyber Event Response Team (CERT) service. Cohesity CERT is available to all customers as part of their Cohesity subscription.

By adding an experienced team to supplement the incident response investigation in its earliest stages, Cohesity CERT helps bring order and clarity to a chaotic and confusing time for your business. You'll gain added confidence that your data is protected with its integrity preserved.

Many organizations lack the expertise or resources to respond effectively to attacks. Cohesity CERT provides fast, expert assistance during incidents, ensuring minimal disruption and faster recovery.

We believe it's not just about preventing incidents; it's about minimizing the impact if breached, including removing the threat and regaining control and access to your data. Cohesity CERT is with you in good times and bad to make sure your business is prepared to recover quickly and securely from cyberattacks.

## Cohesity Hardware Refresh Service

## End-of-Life Cluster Hardware Refresh

Even in today's cloud data management landscape, it is still important for on-prem environments to periodically refresh key components of the IT infrastructure to maximize performance; rather than using systems until they can no longer function.

A planned hardware refresh, known well in advance, allows management to make informed budgeting and purchasing decisions, mitigates risk of unexpected failures, and eliminates the pressures of needing to replace everything all at once.

Advanced Services is now offering a Hardware Refresh service to assist customers with the proactive replacement/replenishment of their End-of-life (EOL) cluster hardware. The service includes Cluster Node replacement/installation in increments of up to four (4) nodes.

## High Level Workflow

- · Confirm hardware replacement compatibility
- · Capture installation requirements and confirm site readiness
- · Prepare and image nodes with desired release version
- · Initiate the node-add process on-site
- · Complete the remaining node additions remotely and sequentially
- · Logical remote removal of in-scope nodes from the cluster
- · Verify cluster and node-to-node communications.

Limitations: Service scope includes Cohesity assistance with software-installation, new node additions and logical removal of aged out nodes. Service scope DOES NOT include rack, stack and cabling of 3rd party hardware, un-racking of discarded nodes, data migration, data protection or cluster configuration modifications. Hardware must be purchased separately. Selected cluster replacement hardware must be compatible with existing cluster and Long Term Support (LTS) releases.
