## Cohesity Hardware Refresh Service

## End-of-Life Cluster Hardware Refresh

Even in today's cloud data management landscape, it is still important for on-prem environments to periodically refresh key components of the IT infrastructure to maximize performance; rather than using systems until they can no longer function.

A planned hardware refresh, known well in advance, allows management to make informed budgeting and purchasing decisions, mitigates risk of unexpected failures, and eliminates the pressures of needing to replace everything all at once.

Advanced Services is now offering a Hardware Refresh service to assist customers with the proactive replacement/replenishment of their End-of-life (EOL) cluster hardware. The service includes Cluster Node replacement/installation in increments of up to four (4) nodes.

## High Level Workflow

- · Confirm hardware replacement compatibility
- · Capture installation requirements and confirm site readiness
- · Prepare and image nodes with desired release version
- · Initiate the node-add process on-site
- · Complete the remaining node additions remotely and sequentially
- · Logical remote removal of in-scope nodes from the cluster
- · Verify cluster and node-to-node communications.

Limitations: Service scope includes Cohesity assistance with software-installation, new node additions and logical removal of aged out nodes. Service scope DOES NOT include rack, stack and cabling of 3rd party hardware, un-racking of discarded nodes, data migration, data protection or cluster configuration modifications. Hardware must be purchased separately. Selected cluster replacement hardware must be compatible with existing cluster and Long Term Support (LTS) releases.
