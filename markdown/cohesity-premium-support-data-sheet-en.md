At Cohesity, we care as much about troubleshooting as preventing problems, reducing your operational hassles. Our multicloud data management platform, Cohesity Helios â„¢ , for example, has capabilities that allow you to see, manage and take action on your stored data and applications globally-from a single UI. It features proactive health checks with anomaly alerting and remediation recommendations that stop issues before they negatively impact your business. And if the worst-case happens, Helios can call home to notify Cohesity Premium Support and prevent downtime.
