## Cohesity Node Add Service

Cohesity Advanced Services will add up to four (4) nodes of Cohesity certified platform hardware to an existing cluster. Cohesity will deploy and configure our software on the in-scope hardware and validate that all nodes are communicating across the cluster and network.

- * nodes to be added must be compatible with the existing cluster

## Our Approach

For each deployment, Cohesity Advanced Services will provide you with a Pre-Installation Checklist that details the required infrastructure and configuration information necessary. A member of our team conducts a call with your team to review the checklist, answer any questions, and confirm the prerequisites listed below BEFORE proceeding with the installation.

Cohesity Advanced Services consultants work with your team to:

- · Confirm network readiness for new nodes
- · Validate your existing configuration and confirm compatibility
- · Run health check to validate cluster readiness
- · Work with your network team to prepare the environment for the new nodes
- · Image nodes with the desired release version
- · Add the nodes to the specified data and management networks
- · Add the nodes to the cluster
- · Check cluster status to ensure the process is complete.
