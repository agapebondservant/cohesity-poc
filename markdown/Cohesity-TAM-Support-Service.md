## Your Assigned TAM

Every TAM is a seasoned technical veteran with access to all the information and resources needed to meet your operational goals. Your TAM will assess your current cases, review your project plans and priorities, and capture your initial feedback and suggestions. Your TAM will also set up a regular cadence to review your ongoing experience, provide reports about your current environment, and build action plans and recommendations to drive desired outcomes. Your TAM is an opportunity to leverage a single point of contact for assistance, guidance, and advocacy, resolving issues and getting fast access to the information and resources you need from Cohesity.
