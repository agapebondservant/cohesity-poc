Respond faster, recover smarter-because your business can't afford downtime.

## Key Benefits

- • Less downtime and data loss
- • Rapid incident response
- • Efficient  data restoration

Cyberattacks are one of the biggest causes of data loss and downtime. Cyberattacks are not a matter of if but when. Ransomware, data breaches, and wiper attacks are on the rise, and businesses of all sizes are vulnerable. When an attack occurs, the focus shifts from prevention to response and recovery so the organization can continue operating.

- • Expert guidance in a crisis

To reduce the impact of a cyberattack, we've enhanced our world-class data security solution with a dedicated Cyber Event Response Team (CERT) service. Cohesity CERT is available to all customers as part of their Cohesity subscription.

By adding an experienced team to supplement the incident response investigation in its earliest stages, Cohesity CERT helps bring order and clarity to a chaotic and confusing time for your business. You'll gain added confidence that your data is protected with its integrity preserved.

Many organizations lack the expertise or resources to respond effectively to attacks. Cohesity CERT provides fast, expert assistance during incidents, ensuring minimal disruption and faster recovery.

We believe it's not just about preventing incidents; it's about minimizing the impact if breached, including removing the threat and regaining control and access to your data. Cohesity CERT is with you in good times and bad to make sure your business is prepared to recover quickly and securely from cyberattacks.
