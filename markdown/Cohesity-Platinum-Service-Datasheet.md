## Service

## Accelerate resolution, proactively optimize operations, and get recommendations

Cohesity Platinum Service maximizes enterprise customers' value from the Cohesity multicloud data management platform. It provides customers with priority handling of support cases and account advocacy through direct access to assigned technical experts. Platinum Service customers have the benefit of additional focused attention and single pointof-contact issue resolution from both a Cohesity Designated Support Engineer (DSE) and a Cohesity Technical Account Manager (TAM).

Named individuals, your DSE works on your priority cases while your TAM continually advocates for your needs, coordinates Cohesity resources for your strategic planning benefit, and helps your organization quickly resolve issues.

## Your Assigned DSE

Every DSE is a senior support engineer and will be directly responsible for handling your priority cases. Our DSEs are experienced with all aspects of the Cohesity platform and they will be able to provide environment-specific insights that help overcome existing issues to achieve business objectives.

## Your Assigned TAM

Every TAM is a seasoned technical veteran with access to all the information and resources needed to meet your operational goals. Your TAM will take immediate action to assess current support cases, review resolution priorities and plans, and capture feedback and suggestions. Your TAM will also work collaboratively with you and your team to set objectives, share feedback with Cohesity, and drive action. TAMs track requested product enhancements and promote roadmap input internally. They establish a regular cadence to review your ongoing experience, provide reports about your current environment, and build action plans and recommendations to drive desired outcomes, ensuring your data is protected and productive across multiclouds.
